Function:
When there exist a number of checks to add, and they have identical parts, datacheck-ini.py will creat or overwrite a txt file named as "ini.txt".

What is needed: 
(1) checkadd.txt: It can be copied from Excel. Two columns are needed. The first column will be readed as $var1, and the second column will be readed as $var2.
(2) config.txt: This is a pattern which needs you to write it manually.

How to run:
Step 1: write a pattern in the config.txt
Step 2: fill the checkadd.txt
Step 3: use cmd to go to the path of datacheck-ini.py, type datacheck-ini.py and press Enter! The output ini.txt file can be found in the same path.

Here is an example config.txt and an example checkadd.txt.
